        <h1 style="text-align: center;">Artificial Intelligence In Healthcare</h1>
        <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is getting increasingly sophisticated at doing what humans do, 
        but more efficiently, rapidly, and at a much lower expense. The potential for AI in healthcare is vast.
        It can resolve many significant strides in the healthcare industry like offering a wide range of tools and increasing efficiency. 
        AI is most efficiently being used in the field of diagnosis and can be trained to diagnose conditions such as cancer and strokes. 
        Tech firms and start-ups are also working assiduously on similar grounds. 
        Google, for example, is collaborating with health delivery networks to build models from big data to warn clinicians of alarming 
        conditions, such as heart failure. The following are some ways in which AI is being used in healthcare,
        also few potential benefits and challenges that it brings along:</p>
        <br>

        <p><b><u>Clinical Methodology:</u></b></p>
        <p>Pathological analysis of cells is considered to be a premium standard of diagnosis and allows microscopy slides to be scanned 
        and analyzed. AI-led tools have contributed to diagnosing a number of diseases like breast cancer, gastric cancer, etc. 
        Several models including neural networks have shown accuracy similar to human pathologists, and in some cases even better than 
        humans alone. AI can be used to highlight areas of concern along with identifying histological findings at levels beyond human visibility. 
        Thus, AI is used to assist doctors to make decisions and provides them with vast amounts of medical data and analysis. 
        AI can analyze records, genetic data, and endoscopy reports to a good extent which can help doctors diagnose, and treat those 
        diseases more accurately. The greatest challenge is not whether it is useful enough but rather ensuring its adoption in daily 
        clinical practice.</p>
        <br>

        <p><b><u>Patient Monitoring:</u></b></p>
        <p>Patient monitoring has expanded the reach of practices that were earlier thought to be available in urban areas only. 
        The continuous advancement of technology and capability has affected healthcare and has led to a boost in deliveries of medicines 
        to homes and more pockets. Thus, AI can help by capturing vital signs, well-being metrics, and background data. 
        Such an atmosphere can help us in real-time monitoring and pre-emptive interactions between proficient and the needful to prevent 
        atrocities. These can also improve the quality of decisions and can be of great help to the longitudinal metrics. 
        AI can provide doctors with some real-time data on patient health and allows a passage for early intervention if required. 
        This can reduce the need for hospitalization, improve the outcomes to a greater extent, and can reduce healthcare costs.</p>
        <br>

        <p><b><u>Drug Discovery:</u></b></p>
        <p>Drug development has a crucial spot in the industry as it involves bringing a new drug molecule into clinical practice.
        It encompasses all steps from basic research of finding a suitable molecular target to supporting the launch. 
        However, it is being limited due to a lack of advanced technologies which in turn makes it an expensive and time-consuming process.
        AI can be used to recognize certain compounds and can provide validation for the drug structure design. 
        Models can also be used to implement safe and efficient evaluations of drug molecules based on data modelling and analysis. 
        In addition to drug discovery and development, data analysis and broader data sets could help professionals assess risks
        and predict disease at a safer stage. Currently, AI algorithms are being trained to an extent that they can predict the 
        efficacy of new drugs and identify potential side effects, reducing the risk, and cost associated with drug development.</p>
        <br>

        <p><b><u>Potential Benefits:</u></b></p>
        <p>AI has enough potential to revolutionize the industry by providing personalized and efficient care to patients, reducing costs, 
        and also improving outcomes. It has reduced healthcare costs by allowing organizations to use more sophisticated technology that's 
        accurate and efficient which has also led to better outcomes. It comes with a set of tools designed to scan for errors, optimization, 
        and provide timely access to results. It takes care of the fact, that no critical information goes unnoticed because it might lead 
        to biased results and inaccuracies.
        <br>After being this efficient and a do-it-all tool for the medical industry, AI still has a lot of challenges to deal with like 
        privacy concerns, biased results, and dependency on data provided. Thus it still cannot be relied upon for complete analysis 
        without any human intervention.</p>
        <br>

        <p><b><u>Conclusion:</u></b></p>
        <p>AI is transforming various medical methods and is providing doctors with new tools to treat ailments. 
        While the benefits are numerous, there are also certain drawbacks. As it continues to develop, we can expect more applications 
        and personalized care with more efficiency. It will be able to enhance preventive care and quality of living, cheaper 
        and better diagnoses along with treatment plans. It can also predict and track the spread of infectious diseases by analyzing data
        from government, healthcare, and other sources. Thus, it can act as a powerful tool for combating epidemics and pandemics on the same
        grounds.</p>
