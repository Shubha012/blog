            <u><b>WHY MACHINE LEARNING</b></u>
        </p><br>
        <p>Machine learning is one of the fields that is growing rapidly in computer science because of several factors like the advancement
        of technology, availability of datasets, growth of automation, increased investment in machine learning, increased awareness of 
        machine learning benefits and much more. AI and machine learning jobs have jumped by almost 75% over the past four years and 
        are poised to keep growing. IT analyst firm, Info-Tech Research Group reports that 44% of private sector companies plan to 
        invest in AI systems in 2023. 63% of companies surveyed plan to increase or maintain AI and machine learning spending in 2023. 
        That is partly why machine learning is important and why we should start learning it.

            <u><b>1. Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow </b></u>
        </p>
        <p><b>Author: </b>Aurelien Geron</p>
        
        <br><p>This book is specially designed for beginners and is highly recommended. 
        It covers the fundamentals of Machine Learning techniques including supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement, and deep learning. 
        Basic algorithms like linear regression, logistic regression, tree-based, support vector machines, and random forest. 
        It basically starts from the initial to the final so highly recommended for beginners.</p>
