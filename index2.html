        <h1 style="text-align: center;">Deep Learning Algorithms for Medical Image Processing</h1>
        <p>Medical imaging has changed the face of the modern healthcare sector by precisely imaging the human body and treating chronic diseases. 
        According to EMC Digital Universe, hospitals are generating 50 Peta-bytes of data every year across the globe. 
        A staggering 90% of all the healthcare data comes from medical imaging where more than 97% of it goes un-analyzed or un-used.
        Such heavy database generation, storage, and accurate interpretation represent an enormous challenge for healthcare organizations. 
        It is even more challenging for developing countries like India where every year 5.2 million deaths are reported due to incorrect or 
        late diagnosis, improper team coordination, and shortage of medical staff and devices in the hospital. Computerized medical 
        imaging analysis is an essential current need to reduce error, costs, and processing time, and accelerate medical prognosis.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Recent progresses in deep learning have shed new light on medical image analysis by finding meaningful associations and patterns 
        which are present time-consuming or repetitive, and difficult to analyze by skilled healthcare professionals. 
        Deep learning algorithm-based machines try to interpret, classify and quantify imaging data in the form of complex patterns 
        and structures by building multi-layer artificial neural networks. These neural networks consist of interconnected neurons 
        grouped into three different types of layers namely input, hidden, and output layer(s). </p>
        <br>
        <p>The word 'deep' refers to multiple numbers of hidden layers (sometimes, more than 1000). Each neuron connection is associated with 
        a random weight. They can be set according to the importance of the input value. After receiving the raw data at the input layer, 
        complex mathematical associations and patterns are made and tested in the hidden layers. Such a network now learns these patterns and 
        may predict new data and or identify similar data. It is very similar to the learning process that occurs in our brain's neocortex. </p>
        <br>
        <p>The power of deep learning algorithms is not limited to the identification of unhealthy tissues, performing repetitive segmentation 
        tasks, and automation of imaging processes but also the detection and prediction (years before) of chronic disorders like epilepsy, 
        Alzheimer's, different types of cancers, depression, etc. According to Signify Research - a market intelligence and consultancy to 
        the global healthcare technology industry, deep learning-based healthcare solutions will become a $300 million industry by 2021. 
        There are already a number of FDA-approved life-saving AI diagnostic devices such as IDX - DR for detecting retinopathy, 
        QauntX for evaluating breast abnormalities, Aidoc for identifying intracranial haemorrhages in head CT scans and etc in the market.
