        <p><b>Hackathon</b></p>
        <p>48 hours of your daily routine where you just forget the world. These 48 hours are filled with nervousness, excitement, 
        overflow of ideas, blank brains, sleepless nights, coffee the bff, and just a lot of memories/experience with learning.</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>Is a Hackathon is Really necessary????</b></p>
        <br>
        <p>I am not going to answer this question. You can figure it out automatically after the end of this section.

            1.Connections - Hackathons are one of the best platforms where you meet different tech geeks who are in this ocean for years. Effective networking leads to different opportunities. 
            
            2.Innovation -  “People who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones who do.” — Steve Jobs. 48 hours where you have to put your whole soul to a single task and make it alive. Thinking of new ideas, and shaping it accordingly is a dream come true. Doing this in a competitive environment keeps your enthusiasm at peak. 
            
            3.Determination - Working on a single topic for just 10-15 hours is overwhelming. But here all the participants are working on a single problem statement for about 48 hours. This determination not just ends after the hackathon but it also affects your routine and you are ready to take up any project or goal.
